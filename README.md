# Google Code Jam

Solution for GCJ problems.
The templates that I use are: **GCJ2018_Problem.cs** (for CSharp) and **solverTemplate.txt** (for C/C++).

# GCJ 2018

I switched from C to C# as the main language to speed-up development.
The practice problems use multiple files (base solver classes), but for the contest single files must be used (basically copy and rename **GCJ2018_Problem.cs**.

# GCJ 2014

Contains the qualification problems and some solutions for round 1 (C/C++).
